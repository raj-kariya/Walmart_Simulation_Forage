# Here is the background information on your task


The Walmart pet department has decided to combine its numerous databases into a single source of truth. The centralized database will save much time and effort when it comes to querying the data and collecting metrics. They just got approval to begin the project, so now itâ€™s up to your team to begin putting the database together. The first step is to figure out the database schema. You have been selected to design the database, and are expected to have the first draft of an ERD completed shortly. The pet department has sent over a list of requirements the design must satisfy and are eager to get started. Good luck!
